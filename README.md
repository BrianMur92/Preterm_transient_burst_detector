Preterm transient burst detector: a guide
============================================

This repo is to serve as a guide on how to use the fully trained preterm transient burst detector xgboost model.

This model corresponds to the 2020 EMBC paper titled 'Detection of Transient Bursts in the EEG of Preterm Infants using
Time–Frequency Distributions and Machine Learning'

## Requirements
Python 3.7 or newer with the following packages installed
| Package       | Version installed  |
| ------------- |:------------------:|
| pandas        | 0.25.1             |
| numpy         | 1.17.1             |
| xgboost       | 0.90               |
| mne           | 0.18.2             |
| scikit-learn  | 0.21.3             |
| scipy         | 1.3.1              |



The current version of the code requires MATLAB to compute the time-frequency distributions. The [memeff_TFDs](https://github.com/otoolej/memeff_TFDs)
MATLAB package is what is used to generate the time-frequency distributions.
Please download this package change the variable `path_to_TFD_package`, an input variable to use_model.main(), 
to the location of the package.

To use MATLAB commands in python the following link provides details on how to install the MATLAB engine [LINK](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html).

**Note**: A future release will be all python when the MATLAB functions are converted into python.


## Use 

Set path `Preterm_transient_burst_detector` to the folder location of the downloaded files. 
Then the following will load the main functions:
```
  import sys
  sys.path.append(Preterm_transient_burst_detector)
  import use_model
```

Example when using the demo_data.edf file
```
eeg_ts_data, tfd_data_df, y_preds_probs = use_model.main(path_to_TFD_package='path_to_memeff_TFDs_package')
```
**Note**: To use a different edf file call function like so
```
eeg_ts_data, tfd_data_df, y_preds_probs = use_model.main(file_name='Own_edf_file.edf', path_to_TFD_package='path_to_memeff_TFDs_package')
```


Example when the eeg data is saved in a csv file (assuming it is bi-polar order, has been filtered and downsampled to 64 Hz)
```
import pandas as pd
eeg_data = pd.read_csv('demo_data.csv')
eeg_df, tfd_data_df, y_preds_probs = use_model.main(eeg_data=eeg_data, Fs=64, file_name='File_1', channel='F3_C3', path_to_TFD_package='path_to_memeff_TFDs_package')
```
**Note**: A user can load the data whatever way they like as long as it is passed into the main function as a DataFrame, 
where the column names are the bi-polar channel names. If the data is not sampled at 64 Hz please filter and downsample 
to 64 Hz. This can be done either before passing the data in or it can be coded in the `prepare_EEG_data` function.






## Files
The `use_model` python file (.py file) have a description and an example in the header of each function. To read this
header, type `help(use_model.main)` in the console after importing (`import use_model`), to get information about the
main function.  Directory structure is as follows: 
```
├── CHANGELOG.md                              # Changelog file
├── demo_data.csv                             # Example csv data
├── demo_data.edf                             # example edf data

└── use_model.py                              # File showing how to use the model
```

**NOTE**: demo_data.edf was created using [NEURAL_py_EEG_feature_set](https://github.com/BrianMur92/NEURAL_py_EEG_feature_set).
